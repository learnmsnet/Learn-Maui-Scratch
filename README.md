# Learn .NET MAUI From Scratch

In this course, we will learn the basics of how to build [.NET MAUI][dotnet-maui] applications. Over the length of this course we will learn the parts of a .NET MAUI application and how to make the most use of the solution.  We will start the course with a Hello MAUI application and then we will build an ecommerce application in MAUI and utilize [.NET MAUI Essentials][maui-essentials] in our applications. We will fully theme our application as well as learn how to display data in many different ways.

## Setup Guide

This course will be a hands on course and you will need to have your own device. You can develop with either a PC or Mac and all you will need to install is Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio for Mac 2022 with the .NET MAUI workload. We will be utilizing .NET 7, so you will need to have version 17.4 or newer of Visual Studio 2022 installed.

If this is your first time doing mobile development, it is recommended to have a physical Android device which can be setup in just a few steps. If you don't have a device then you can setup an [Android emulator][android-emulator].

With all that you are good to go with this course.
